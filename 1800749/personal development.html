<h2 align="center" style="color:#80002a;">Personal Development</h2>

	<p>I believe some of my strengths include:
		<ol>
			<li>Adaptability: I can quickly adapt to new situations and environments, allowing me to succeed in a variety of settings.</li>

			<li>Technical Skills: I have a strong understanding of a variety of technical tools and systems and am able to apply this knowledge effectively to complete projects and solve problems.</li>

			<li>Organization: I can keep track of multiple tasks and responsibilities while also effectively prioritizing my time to meet deadlines. I learned this skill through time management techniques and the use of tools such as to-do lists and calendars.</li>
		</ol>
		
I've spent the last three to five years actively working to develop and refine these skills. This has included looking for new ways to challenge myself, such as taking on difficult technical projects, and seeking feedback from professors and peers to help me grow.
