					"A mother's love is peace. It need not be acquired, it need not be deserved." - Erich Fromm <br><br>
					This saying perfectly expresses the character traits of a loving, kind, and modest mother who gives her kids security, comfort, and unwavering love.

					I enjoy being alone because it allows me to think and reflect in peace. I also enjoy engaging in physical activity, whether through exercise or going for a swim. Both of these activities allow me to stretch myself and clear my mind. Taking the time to think and ponder is also important to me because it allows me to gain new perspectives and learn more about myself.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="3"><strong>Dislikes:</strong><br>
					I dislike loud noise because it can be distracting and interfere with my ability to focus and relax. Too much talking is also exhausting and overwhelming for me. Public speaking is difficult for me because I am nervous and self-conscious in front of a large audience. Arguing and confrontations are also not something I enjoy because they are stressful and ineffective. Instead, I prefer calm and respectful discussions in which ideas can be shared and understood.

				<td colspan="3"><strong>Hobbies: </strong><br>
					One of my hobbies is playing video games. I have always enjoyed the sense of relaxation and escape that comes with immersing myself in a virtual world and solving challenges within the game. I particularly enjoy the social aspect of gaming, as it allows me to connect with friends and compete against others online.<br><br>

I also enjoy the sense of accomplishment that comes with improving my skills and achieving new levels or accomplishments within a game. Whether I am competing in a fast-paced first-person shooter or exploring a vast open-world role-playing game, I always find myself drawn to the challenges and rewards of video gaming.<br><br>

In addition to playing video games, I also enjoy watching anime. Anime is a style of Japanese animation that often tells compelling and imaginative stories. I appreciate the creativity and artistry that goes into many anime shows and movies, and enjoy the diverse range of genres and storylines that are available.<br><br>

Whether I am watching a heartwarming coming-of-age story or a thrilling action-adventure, I always find something to appreciate in anime. I also enjoy the social aspect of anime, as it allows me to discuss and share my favorite shows with friends who have similar interests.<br><br>

Overall, both playing video games and watching anime are hobbies that bring me enjoyment and relaxation in my free time. They provide a sense of escape from the everyday world, and allow me to engage with my interests and connect with others who share similar passions.

	<p align="center">The validity of the mentioned test is determined by a number of factors, including the quality of the questions, the methodology used, and the sample size. It's also worth noting that personality is complex and multifaceted, and that any test can only capture a portion of it. Furthermore, the context in which the test is administered can have an impact on the results.

To summarize, while online personality tests can be a fun and interesting tool for helping people better understand themselves, they should not be relied on as the only source of information about one's personality.</p><br>
